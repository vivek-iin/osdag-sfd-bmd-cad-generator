🏗️ Osdag Screening Assignment – SFD, BMD Plotter & CAD Column Generator

This project is developed as part of the Osdag Screening Assignment. It includes:

- ✅ Shear Force Diagram (SFD) and Bending Moment Diagram (BMD) generation using Python and matplotlib  
- ✅ CAD drawing of a Laced Compound Column using PythonOCC

1. SFD & BMD Generator
- Reads beam data from an Excel file  
- Calculates support reactions, shear force, and bending moment  
- Plots the SFD and BMD using `matplotlib`

 2. Laced Compound Column CAD Model
- Uses `PythonOCC` to generate a 3D model of a laced compound steel column  
- Incorporates plates, angles, and lacing bars based on design inputs

 🛠️ Tech Stack
 
- Python  
- matplotlib  
- PythonOCC  
- pandas  
- openpyxl
